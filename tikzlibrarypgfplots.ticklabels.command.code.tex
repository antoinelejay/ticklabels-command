% title: read tick labels from the content of a command through a key `(x|y|z)ticklabels from command`
% type: pgfplots library

% usage: \usepgfplotslibrary{ticklabels.command}
% licence: LLPL
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% It is suitable to write 
% \newcommand{\myticks}{1,2,3}
% and then to set 
% xtick=\myticks as parameter to axis.
% However, this cannot be done for xticklabels as the content 
% if the command is considered as the first label.
% This small library provides a new key `(x|y|z)ticklabels from command` in which 
% the labels are expanded
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% The macro for generating a list is recreated with a macro to mark the stop.
% It is adapted from /liststructure/pgfplotsliststructure.code.tex

% The code is adapted from pgfplots.code.tex
% \expandafter is insterted so that #1 is expanded.
